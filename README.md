A cross-platform desktop application for monitoring and managing your
investments from different brokers, with real-time market data integration from
Yahoo Finance. Developed with Qt.

## Motivation

Managing investments across different brokers can be challenging, as existing
broker-specific systems such as Trading 212 often limit users to viewing
investments exclusively within their own platforms. This leads to scattered
investment information and a lack of holistic oversight. While some users
resort to manual data entry in spreadsheets, this approach lacks real-time
market data and user-friendliness.

This application offers a centralised solution for monitoring and managing
investments across different brokers. By providing real-time market data
integration and a user-friendly interface, it enhances the investment management
experience. Additionally, as a desktop application, it prioritises data privacy
by storing all information locally on the user's computer. Leveraging the Qt
framework ensures cross-platform compatibility and high performance.

## Usage

### Operating System

Compatible with:

- macOS
- Windows
<!-- Test Linux compatibility with PyQt6, as Linux doesn't work with PySide6. -->

### Installing Dependencies

Run the following command from the [project root](./) directory:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Running the Application

Run the following command from the [project root](./) directory:

```bash
poetry run app
```

### Running Tests

Run the following command from the [project root](./) directory:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

### Importing and Exporting Databases

DuckDB uses a binary file format which is inefficient, not human-readable, and
leads to merge conflicts, so we avoid version controlling the database file
directly. Instead, we store the data and schema of the database in the folder
[/resources/portfolio_data/](/resources/portfolio_data/) -- this gives us
human-readable, merge-friendly files that we can easily version control.

To **import** the database, run the following command from the [project root](./)
directory:

```bash
poetry run export_db
```

To **export** the database, run the following command from the [project root](./)
directory:

```bash
poetry run import_db
```

Note that importing the database won't work if
[/resources/portfolio.db](./resources/portfolio.db) already exists â€“ you must
rename it, move it, or delete it before importing.

## Data Privacy

We store all data locally on the user's computer in a
DuckDB database at [/resources/portfolio.db](./resources/portfolio.db). Live
market data is fetched from Yahoo Finance, but we do not store any of this data
permanently.
